Based on the results of the `ompbenchmark.sh` script, we can make the following conclusions:

### Compilation Performance:
- **gfortran:**
  - Compilation Time: 0.08 seconds
  - Max Resident Set Size: 30108 kbytes
  - Page Faults (Minor): 6483

- **ifort:**
  - Compilation Time: 0.27 seconds
  - Max Resident Set Size: 64368 kbytes
  - Page Faults (Minor): 29565

- **ifx:**
  - Compilation Time: 0.25 seconds
  - Max Resident Set Size: 120648 kbytes
  - Page Faults (Minor): 24269

### Execution Performance:
- **gfortran:**
  - Elapsed Time: 0.01 seconds
  - User Time: 0.03 seconds
  - System Time: 0.03 seconds
  - Max Resident Set Size: 80656 kbytes
  - Page Faults (Minor): 19668

- **ifort:**
  - Elapsed Time: 0.02 seconds
  - User Time: 0.03 seconds
  - System Time: 0.03 seconds
  - Max Resident Set Size: 81064 kbytes
  - Page Faults (Minor): 19815

- **ifx:**
  - Elapsed Time: 0.02 seconds
  - User Time: 0.04 seconds
  - System Time: 0.03 seconds
  - Max Resident Set Size: 81068 kbytes
  - Page Faults (Minor): 19816

### Observations and Conclusions:

1. **Compilation Time:**
   - `gfortran` has the fastest compilation time (0.08 seconds), followed by `ifx` (0.25 seconds) and `ifort` (0.27 seconds).
   - Both Intel compilers (`ifort` and `ifx`) have significantly higher memory usage during compilation compared to `gfortran`.

2. **Execution Time:**
   - All compilers (gfortran, ifort, and ifx) show very close execution times with minor differences.
   - `gfortran` shows a slightly faster execution time (0.01 seconds elapsed) compared to `ifort` and `ifx` (0.02 seconds elapsed).
   - The performance gain with parallelization is evident as all compilers utilized multiple CPU cores efficiently, achieving over 370% CPU usage.

3. **Resource Usage:**
   - The maximum resident set size during execution is similar across all compilers (around 80,000 kbytes).
   - Minor page faults are also quite similar across all compilers during execution, indicating comparable memory access patterns.

4. **Parallelization Effectiveness:**
   - The use of OpenMP parallelization has significantly improved execution performance across all compilers.
   - All compilers effectively parallelized the workload, as indicated by high CPU usage percentages (over 370%).

### Overall Conclusion:

- **Performance:** The performance of the parallelized code is quite comparable across all three compilers with minor differences in execution time.
- **Compilation Efficiency:** `gfortran` is the most efficient in terms of compilation time and memory usage. However, `ifort` and `ifx` are also competitive, albeit with slightly higher resource requirements during compilation.
- **Parallelization:** OpenMP parallelization has been successful in enhancing the performance, and all compilers leverage multiple CPU cores effectively.

### Recommendation:

- For quick compilation and reasonable execution performance, `gfortran` is a strong choice.
- For potentially better optimizations specific to Intel CPUs, `ifort` and `ifx` may offer advantages in more complex scenarios or larger codebases.
- Continued use and experimentation with different flags and optimization levels can further fine-tune performance based on specific needs and system characteristics.
